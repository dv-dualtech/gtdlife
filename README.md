2. Event System
   ```typescript
   // Core Event Types
   interface BaseEvent {
       id: string;
       timestamp: Date;
       deviceId: string;
       type: EventType;
   }

   interface CaptureEvent extends BaseEvent {
       content: any;
       metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
   }

   interface UpdateEvent extends BaseEvent {
       itemId: string;
       changes: Record<string, unknown>;
   }
   ```

3. Data Storage
